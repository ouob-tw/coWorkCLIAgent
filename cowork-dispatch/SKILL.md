# CoWork Dispatch

Coordinate the Claude Code side of CoWork: spec and plan preparation, YAML queue setup, approved task dispatch, session health checks, status reporting, and result cleanup.

Keep this `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Use relative paths for bundled files.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks for any of the following:

- CoWork, Claude Code + Codex CLI collaboration, or Codex task dispatch.
- Initializing `.cowork/`, `.cowork/tasks.yaml`, or `.cowork/results.yaml`.
- Writing or reviewing a spec or implementation plan with Codex plugin assistance.
- Dispatching approved execution work to an external Codex CLI session.
- Checking CoWork queue status, result status, or `cx-` zmx sessions.
- Cleaning CoWork results.

## Role Boundaries

- Claude Code drafts specs, fixes major spec issues, reviews Codex-produced plans against the spec, and dispatches approved execution tasks.
- Codex plugin is used only inside the Claude Code session for spec review and implementation plan drafting or correction.
- External Codex CLI is used only for execution tasks from `.cowork/tasks.yaml`.
- `tasks.yaml` is only for approved execution work. Never put spec review, plan review, or planning tasks into YAML.

## Default Execution Mode

When the user says "cowork", "CoWork", or activates the collaboration flow, run the **full pipeline end-to-end** without pausing between phases:

```
init → spec (brainstorm + draft + Codex review loop) → plan (Codex draft + Claude review loop + commit) → dispatch → monitor → verify results → report
```

**Continue by default.** Do not ask for confirmation between phases. After each phase completes, immediately proceed to the next. Report progress in one sentence per phase transition (e.g., "Spec approved, proceeding to plan.").

**Do not infer completion.** A phase is complete only when its required review, approval, dispatch, monitor, or verification step has actually run and produced the expected result. Do not treat file existence, prior conversation context, or assistant confidence as proof that spec, plan, dispatch, monitor, or verification is complete.

**Do not skip steps by default.** Run every phase and required substep unless the user explicitly asks to skip that specific step. If the user requests a skip, state which step is being skipped and continue with the remaining required workflow.

**Pause only when:**

- A design choice or ambiguity requires user decision (e.g., approach A vs B during brainstorm).
- Codex review raises a major issue that has multiple valid resolutions.
- An unrecoverable error occurs (quota exhausted on all accounts, zmx session conflict).
- Codex execution fails with `status: failed` in results.

**Do not pause for:**

- Spec minor corrections — Codex or Claude Code fixes them and continues.
- Plan gaps or contradictions — send feedback to Codex, re-review, continue.
- 503 errors — auto-retry with `zmx send "GO"` and continue.
- Quota exhaustion on one account — auto-switch with `codex-multi-auth` and continue.
- Test failures during Codex execution — Codex handles them per the plan.

**After Codex completes:** read `.cowork/results.yaml`, review the diff (`git diff`), run the full test suite, and report the final status to the user. If all tests pass, the flow is done. If tests fail or results show `partial`/`failed`, diagnose and report.

## Commands

### init

1. Create `.cowork/` in the project root if missing.
2. Create `.cowork/tasks.yaml` with `[]` if missing.
3. Create `.cowork/results.yaml` with `[]` if missing.
4. Do not overwrite non-empty existing queue or result files.

### spec

1. Use the Superpowers brainstorming workflow before drafting requirements.
2. Use the Superpowers writing-plans workflow when turning requirements into a durable spec or plan-ready artifact.
3. Claude Code writes the initial spec draft.
4. Call the Codex plugin to review the spec.
5. If Codex finds small issues, Codex may directly correct them.
6. If Codex finds major design, missing-requirement, or architecture issues, Claude Code fixes the spec and resubmits it for review.
7. Repeat until the spec is approved.
8. Do not write any spec review task to `.cowork/tasks.yaml`.

### plan

1. Start only after the spec is approved.
2. Call the Codex plugin to produce an implementation plan.
3. Claude Code reviews the plan against the approved spec.
4. If the plan has gaps, contradictions, or scope drift, send feedback to Codex and review the corrected plan again.
5. When the spec and plan are both approved, commit them together with:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "docs: add <feature-name> spec and implementation plan"
   ```

6. Do not write plan drafting or plan review work to `.cowork/tasks.yaml`.

### dispatch

1. Confirm the implementation plan is approved by an actual completed review loop. Do not dispatch from a plan that merely exists or appears complete.
2. Create **one summary task** that points to the plan file. Do not split the plan into multiple granular tasks — Codex reads the plan itself and executes phases in order.
3. Read `.cowork/tasks.yaml` using the queue rules below.
4. Append the task with stable field order:
   `task_id`, `goal`, `context`, `constraints`, `created_by`, `created_at`.
   - `goal`: a single sentence describing the full feature implementation.
   - `context.plan_file`: path to the approved plan.
   - `context.spec_file`: path to the approved spec (if any).
   - `context.related_files`: key files Codex should be aware of.
   - `constraints`: preserve user instructions and implementation constraints from the plan.
5. Use a zmx session name in the form `cx-<short-english-task-name>`, such as `cx-user-api` or `cx-auth-module`.
6. Run `zmx list` before starting. If the target session already exists, stop and report the conflict; do not overwrite it.
7. Start Codex CLI in **detached mode** with `zmx run -d` and `bash -c` to avoid quoting issues:

   ```bash
   zmx run cx-<name> -d bash -c 'codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox "You are the cowork-runner. Read .cowork/tasks.yaml, execute all pending implementation tasks following the cowork-runner skill, write .cowork/results.yaml, remove completed tasks, then exit."'
   ```

   **Important zmx notes:**
   - Always use `zmx run -d` (detached). Without `-d`, zmx blocks the calling terminal and the session is killed if the caller (e.g. Claude Code) exits.
   - Always wrap the codex command with `bash -c '...'`. zmx passes arguments as-is; without `bash -c`, a command string with flags is treated as a single executable name.
   - Use `codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` (not `codex exec`; the full client handles zmx sessions correctly).

8. **Initial error check** — after starting the zmx session, run a delayed health check as a **background task** using Bash `run_in_background: true`:

   ```bash
   sleep 180 && zmx history cx-<name> | tail -20
   ```

   **Claude Code integration:** You MUST call Bash with `run_in_background: true` for this command. Claude Code blocks leading `sleep` in foreground commands. The background task will notify you when it completes — do not poll or check on it. Continue to step 12 (completion monitoring) immediately after launching this background check; handle any errors (steps 9-11) when the background result arrives.

   Rules:
   - Do not calculate elapsed time from `zmx list`, `created=...`, `date +%s`, or any other zmx timestamp output.
   - Do not parse `created_at` or `completed_at` for waiting or completion checks; those fields are YAML metadata only.

9. If history shows a 503-style error, run:

   ```bash
   zmx send cx-<name> "GO"
   ```

   Report: `Encountered 503; retried.`

10. If history shows account quota exhaustion:
    1. Run `codex-multi-auth check`.
    2. Find an account with available quota.
    3. Run `codex-multi-auth switch <account-number>`.
    4. Run `zmx send cx-<name> "GO"`.
    5. Report: `Switched account and retried.`

11. If no account has quota, report that manual action is required. Do not delete dispatched tasks from `.cowork/tasks.yaml`.

12. **Completion monitoring** — use the **Monitor** tool to poll for task completion and session health. Do not repeatedly call `zmx history` manually.

    ```bash
    EXPECTED_TASK_ID="<dispatched-task_id>"
    SESSION="cx-<name>"
    ITER=0
    while true; do
      if ! zmx list 2>/dev/null | grep -q "$SESSION"; then
        echo "ALERT: session $SESSION no longer running"
        zmx history "$SESSION" | tail -20
        break
      fi
      if [ -f .cowork/results.yaml ] && uv run --with pyyaml python - "$EXPECTED_TASK_ID" <<'PY'
    import sys; from pathlib import Path; import yaml
    expected = sys.argv[1]
    data = yaml.safe_load(Path(".cowork/results.yaml").read_text()) or []
    sys.exit(0 if isinstance(data, list) and data and isinstance(data[0], dict) and data[0].get("task_id") == expected else 1)
    PY
      then
        echo "DONE: task $EXPECTED_TASK_ID completed"
        zmx history "$SESSION" | tail -20
        break
      fi
      ITER=$((ITER + 1))
      if [ $((ITER % 6)) -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "heartbeat: session $SESSION still running, waiting for results ($((ITER * 30))s elapsed)"
      fi
      sleep 30
    done
    ```

    **Claude Code integration:** Use the **Monitor** tool (not Bash) to run this script. Set `timeout_ms` to `3600000` (1 hour) and `persistent` to `false`. Each `echo` line becomes a notification — you will be alerted immediately if the session dies, get a heartbeat every ~3 minutes, and see the final `zmx history` output on completion. Continue working or wait for notifications after launching the monitor.

    Rules:
    - The monitor checks two things each iteration: (1) session is still alive via `zmx list`, (2) `results.yaml` contains the expected `task_id`.
    - Completion is confirmed only when parsed `.cowork/results.yaml` is a YAML list whose first item is a dict and its `task_id` matches the dispatched task's `task_id`.
    - Do not treat `tasks.yaml` → `[]`, `.cowork/results.yaml` existence, or zmx history output as completion; those are auxiliary signals only.
    - Use `sleep 30`, not `sleep 10`.
    - Do not launch additional `zmx history` checks outside the monitor. The monitor handles everything.
    - If the monitor emits `ALERT` (session died), check the tail output for errors and handle per steps 9-11.

13. Tell the user:
    - `zmx attach cx-<name>` shows live progress.
    - `zmx history cx-<name> | tail -20` shows recent output.
    - `zmx wait cx-<name>` blocks until the session task completes.
    - `zmx list` shows all sessions.
    - `Ctrl+\` detaches from an attached session without terminating Codex.

### status

1. Read `.cowork/tasks.yaml`; missing, empty string, or `[]` means no pending tasks.
2. Read `.cowork/results.yaml`; missing, empty string, or `[]` means no recorded results.
3. Summarize:
   - pending tasks from `tasks.yaml`
   - completed results
   - failed results
   - partial results
4. Run `zmx list` and include `cx-` session status when available.

### clean

1. Reset `.cowork/results.yaml` to `[]`.
2. Do not modify `.cowork/tasks.yaml`.

## Task Generation Rules

- **One task per dispatch.** Create a single summary task that covers the entire approved plan. Codex reads the plan file and executes phases autonomously. Do not decompose the plan into per-phase or per-file tasks.
- Task `task_id` values use `task-{unix_ms}-{random_hex_3}`, for example `task-1747536000000-a3f`.
- Each task contains only:
  - `task_id`
  - `goal` — one sentence describing the full implementation scope
  - `context`
    - `plan_file` — path to the approved plan (Codex reads this to determine phases and steps)
    - `spec_file` — path to the approved spec (optional)
    - `related_files` — key files Codex should be aware of
  - `constraints` — preserve implementation constraints from the approved plan and user instructions
  - `created_by: claude-code`
  - `created_at`
- All paths use project-root-relative format.
- Do not include spec review, plan review, or planning-only work.

## Queue File Rules

- If `.cowork/tasks.yaml` is missing, an empty string, or `[]`, treat it as an empty queue.
- If `.cowork/tasks.yaml` cannot be parsed as YAML:
  1. Back it up as `.cowork/tasks.yaml.bad`, using a timestamped unique name if that file already exists.
  2. Create a new `.cowork/tasks.yaml` containing `[]`.
  3. Report the backup and reset to the user.
- Write YAML with stable field order to avoid unnecessary large diffs.
